# To-do-list-v2

This is a basic "to do list" web app! It's something that I created whilst starting out with JavaScript, as a learning exercise. 

You can view the project here:

- Fully functional on touch devices
- The design is mobile responsive
- Clicking on status label changes which list the item is in
- Empty list items can't be created
- List items are stored within the browser (lost after tab is closed)
